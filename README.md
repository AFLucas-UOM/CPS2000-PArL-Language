# CPS2000 - PArL Language
This repository contains the source code and documentation for the PArL Language, a simple programming language developed as part of the `CPS2000 module at the University of Malta`. The project showcases the implementation of a custom language with basic features that demonstrate core principles of language design such as lexing, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation and interpretation.

## Introduction

- This repository contains the source code and documentation for the new imperative-style programming language **PArL**, created for educational purposes.
- The project demonstrates the fundamentals of language design, including: lexing, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation and interpretation, as well as basic language features like variables, arithmetic operations, conditionals, and loops.
- **WARNING**: Users should follow the provided instructions carefully to ensure the PArL language interpreter functions correctly. Running the interpreter with incorrectly formatted source files may lead to unexpected behavior.

## Motivation

The PArL language was developed to provide a hands-on learning experience in creating a simple yet functional new programming language. It emphasizes the core concepts of programming language theory, offering insights into how languages are parsed and interpreted.

## Features

- Custom language with basic syntax for variable declarations, arithmetic operations, conditionals, and loops.
- A parser and interpreter designed from scratch to process and execute PArL programs.
- Modular design, allowing for easy extension and experimentation with additional language features.

## Usage
It is necessary to run the Main.py script from the terminal in order to use this implementation. This script requires the path to a text file containing the input source code as a command-line argument. To run the script, use the following command:
  ```bash
  python3 ./path/to/Main.py ./path/to/source.txt
  ```

In this case, replace `./path/to/Main.py` with the actual path to the Main.py script and `./path/to/source.txt` with the path to your source code file.
Please ensure that the current working directory (pwd) is set to the "2. Code" folder when executing this command. 

## Getting Started
